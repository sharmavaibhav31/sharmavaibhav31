## 💫 About Me

I’m a **developer and learner** passionate about building at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Cybersecurity** — crafting systems that are not just smart, but also secure and resilient.

💡 I believe the future of digital systems depends on **intelligent security** — where ML isn’t just about prediction, but about protection, detection, and adaptation.

🎯 My focus areas include:
- **AI-driven Threat Detection** (malware analysis, anomaly detection, behavioral learning)
- **Adversarial Machine Learning & Explainable AI**
- **Secure ML Pipelines & Data Privacy**
- **Cross-domain innovation** — blending cybersecurity insights with full-stack and mobile development.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Exploring Right Now
- **Machine Learning for Cyber Defense** — using ML to detect anomalies, intrusions, and fraud.  
- **Synthetic Data Generation** — building realistic datasets for model training using LLMs.  
- **Offensive & Defensive Security** — pentesting, vulnerability research, and automation.  
- **Secure Backend Systems** — integrating AI with decentralized and cloud-native architectures.  
- **Smart Flutter Apps** — embedding AI models and privacy-first design into mobile apps.

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I often test AI models like I test systems — by trying to **break them intelligently**.  
When I’m not coding, I’m either exploring new exploits or debugging life with caffeine ☕.
